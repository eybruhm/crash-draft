So what we are doing is youre helping and guiding me to achieve my two goals: to integrate my backend to frontend and to deploy online my project. 

We created a general workflow with 10 steps. The Step 4: Port Frontend Components to Vite took us a lot of time and chats (to the point that u forgot what we are doing) that’s why it has its own roadmap. 

As you observe in our roadmap for Step 4, it has a specific format. In creating roadmap, it should have
- Day with indicated goal and description
- Each day have steps
- Each steps have sub-steps and description so I know what we are doing
It doesn’t need to be very very detailed---like writing codes for whole class/file. Just the general detail enough for a beginner to follow. Because what I will do after we created the roadmap, I will send to you the Day and you will recall the goal, steps, and sub-steps and you will do it. Every day we finished have documentation:
*Day - Title
*What was Done (each step and sub-step)
*Files created and modified (this just my addition)
*How to test (to find bugs and we will solve it. we dont move to next day until we are clear)
*Current state
*Important Notes
*Next Steps/Day Preview (connecting to what we did)
*Summary
*[Just send it in Chat Convo so even you can recall it!]

So if u traverse our chat history (from other chat), u will observe it that way. For now, we are not doing any roadmap because I want you to remember (if u can from another chat) it, confirm our progress, and feed ur memory again our context. 

Now your task for now is I want u to deeply review the context I listed:
- /Word Files/Supabase Code
- /Word Files/Sitemap Police & Admin
- /Word Files/Flow Police & Admin
- /Word Files/General Workflow
- /Word Files/AI Suggestions
- redo the Step 1. Deep understanding and collection of context. Read every folders, file, classes, and functions I have in frontend and backend. Even /docs.
- Send me ur understanding and observation, so I can acknowledge you

You will also notice that theres “Admin Web”. To give u another context, we are developing CRASH (Crime Response & Alert System Hub). It has three main users: Police (us), Admin (us later), and Users/Citizens. The Citizens is using a mobile app written in tsx-react-native with built in backend (not our backend nor Django), its developing currently with my friend. We are focusing now on the Police web written in reactjs-vite and Django. Later, we will also do the Admin Web-Django (same backend) integration but after we deploy the police. Its just that, I also have another friend who is currently developing the Admin web. And actually our users are: Police, Citizens, Admin1, and Admin2. Admin level 1 is like the junior IT, its the one that uses our admin web and manage the police accounts. Admin level 2 is the senior it who directly access the database and handles admin1 accounts. Admin2 will use the sql insertion in supabase to register, edit, delete, and manage the admin1 accounts. 

Btw we are highschool ict students. We are beginner and never done this. I never code python before, I never did backend before, so Django is vibecoded. I never code before. I never use reactjs-vite (but that’s why im struggling with nextjs hence we did conversion and porting). That’s why im doing this because I need ur patience and guidance. Pls transfer ur knowledge and skills to me without overwhelms me. I still want to learn even this is vibecoded that’s why documentation in chat box is important. 

but yea, I want you first to gain context and understanding. I always give signal before we move and decide. Just ask me, suggest, provide options to me so it also helps u gain more context and info!

For now, we are not doing any roadmap because I want you to absorb it, confirm our progress, and feed ur memory our context.
