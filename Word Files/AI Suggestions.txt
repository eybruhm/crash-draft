Verdict: AI said my backend has EVERYTHING we need for Police Web! I’m in good shape.


This image shows a table outlining free deployment options (No Payment), primarily for students working with backend (Django), frontend (React-Vite), and database (Supabase) technologies.
Here is the information presented in text:
4. Free Deployment Options (No Payment)
Since you're broke students (I get it!), here are completely free options:
Backend (Django)
Option	Free Tier	Notes
Railway	No (paid only)	X
Render	Yes (500 hrs/month)	Good, but sleeps after 15 min inactivity
PythonAnywhere	Yes	Awkward, but works
Replit	Yes (with limits)	Easy, but slow
Fly.io	Yes	Actually pretty good!
Heroku	X (paid now)	Used to be free, not anymore
My suggestion: Render.com – free tier is solid for learning projects.
Frontend (React-Vite)
Option	Free Tier	Notes
Vercel	Yes	Best for Next.js, works fine for static React too
Netlify	Yes	Perfect for React-Vite
GitHub Pages	Yes	Free, but limited (no dynamic routing easily)
My suggestion: Netlify or Vercel – both are great, pick either.
Database (Supabase)
Supabase has a free tier with:
•	500 MB database storage
•	1 GB bandwidth
If you're just storing police reports + messages, you'll be fine!
